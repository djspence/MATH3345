    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximately every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read\n",
    "more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for a sample of 10 U.S. counties during 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data set consists of the following files. On JupyterHub, these files are in the **Data** folder. If you are working in RStudio, download the files from D2L and place them on your machine in any location you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample_PM25.rds\n",
    "This file contains PM2.5 emissions data in the selected cities for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of **tons** of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Below are the columns:\n",
    "- `fips`: A 5-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county\n",
    "- `SCC`: The name of the source represented as a digit string (see source classification code table below)\n",
    "- `Emissions`: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons\n",
    "- `type`: The type of emission source (there are 4 types; explore the data to determine what these are)\n",
    "- `year`: The year for which the emissions were recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Source_Classification_Code.rds\n",
    "This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.\n"
